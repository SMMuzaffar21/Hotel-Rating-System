This repository contains my project based learning of microservices architecture using Spring boot, spring cloud etc

1.Config Service/server = To write the common dependencies etc which will be used by all the microservices

2.Service Registry = To register all the microservices, do load balancing track the status of microservices, use the service name instead of ip to call the microservice
